## S5 invoice-registry — code done, archive blocked on an asymptotic review (2026-07-11)

The storage/logic slice is **complete and excellent**: 239 tests, all code
findings across **7 review rounds** resolved (3 major bugs caught + fixed early;
later rounds only surfaced doc-drift and positive "Clean —" notes). Committed on
`main` with `Slice:`/`Refs:` trailers; not archived.

**Why not archived:** `check-trajectory` (PD-8) needs `review-findings.json`
`clean:true`, i.e. zero confirmed findings. A thorough adversarial review is
**asymptotic** — it always surfaces *something* minor (now: the review-gate's own
tooling changes + one-commit-lagging doc counts). ~14M tokens spent chasing it.
The review-gate itself was hardened along the way: **PD-14** (agent-type names),
**PD-15** (slice-scoped dependency audit), **PD-16** (exclude positive
Clean/Verified/Coverage notes from the defect count; hardened to require a
separator so real defects starting with those words are kept), **PD-17** (don't
review the gate's own evidence artifact).

**Open decision for the human:** PD-8's `clean:true` bar is likely too strict —
it should probably be "no unresolved **actionable** confirmed defects" (severity
-aware / resolved-or-waived), not "zero confirmed". Options: (a) make PD-8
severity-aware and archive; (b) one more review now that the last 3 findings are
fixed; (c) waive. **Do not** hand-edit review-findings.json to clean:true — that
is the forgery PD-3 removed.

## Snapshot

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Branch** | `main` — gate chain made honest; G3 acceptance contract declared |
| **Active capability** | Gate hardening done; **next: S5 `invoice-registry` (first EARNED slice)** |
| **Active OpenSpec changes** | none |
| **Slice / gate** | G0–G3 green/earned · G4+ NOT-EARNED (no earned slice yet) |
| **Gate check** | `node scripts/gate-status.mjs` — Result FAIL (honest: retrofit + no artifacts) |

## Session summary — gate honesty + G3 (2026-07-10 PM)

Project Factory installed (G0). A parallel session had laundered the trajectory
gate; a fresh `process-auditor` confirmed it. Six process fixes landed, each
with an EXECUTED red→green proof and a `Refs: PD-x` trailer:

| Commit | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `3d5efd1` | PD-3/4/5 — retrofit slices render RETROFITTED, not PASS; 10 forged `review-findings.json` deleted (one contradicted its own review doc) |
| `ce7d62d` | PD-9 — `@trace` regex now matches categorized ids |
| `f829e01` | PD-7 — CI runs `gate-status` + the red→green proofs |
| `988ce25` | PD-12 — `@trace` anchored to comment start (a disclaimer had become evidence) |
| `2bc736c` | PD-1 — both checkers treat `dropped` as non-MVP |
| `13518f0` | 20 MVP FRs annotated; **5 of 24 claims refuted** by fresh agents; 14 gaps in `docs/qa/trace-gaps.md` |
| `1ff3b28` | FR-CLIENT-01..04 numbered (capability was outside the trace chain); improvements moved to `retro/improvements/` (PD-13) |
| `069793c` | G3: 43 acceptance-method tags; `@playwright/test` installed; deploy-gated PERF waived |
| `5cb2967` | waiver recorded as correction COR-1 (OPEN) |

**Traceability:** 23/38 MVP FRs honestly traced. `docs/qa/trace-gaps.md` lists
the 14 gaps (4 not-implemented, 2 dropped, 8 needing recording/e2e).

### Evidence contract hardened before S5 (2026-07-10, second session)
Both forgeable trajectory-gate predicates are now closed, so the FIRST earned
slice (S5) inherits an honest contract:
- **PD-10 fixed** (`df5d135`) — a `Slice:` trailer counts only if the commit
  carries a real trailer AND touched `src|app|lib|db|components|tests/`. The
  docs-only forgery is dead. red→green 1/2→2/2.
- **PD-8 fixed** (`1aad54e`) — a `clean:true` review stamp is trusted only from
  a real review-gate output (`generatedBy:"review-gate"` + populated
  `dimensions`). A hand-written stamp is `unverified-stamp`, fails `--release`.
  red→green 3/6→6/6.
- **COR-1 dispositioned** `waived` (`5cb2967`) — deploy-gated PERF, pending live
  measurement. `correct.mjs --check` PASS.

Six gate self-tests now run in CI (`check-{trajectory-retrofit, review-evidence,
slice-trailer, traceability-trace-ids, traceability-anchor, dropped-status}`).

### Still true for the human
- **CI on `main` is RED and that is correct** — `check-trajectory --release`
  exits 1 because all 10 archived slices are RETROFITTED, none earned red-first.
  It goes green when S5 is earned, or via a waiver. Do NOT drop `--release`.

### Open, unfixed process defects (not approved to fix)
- **PD-11** — `factory-lock` over-captures non-gate workflows (`sync-homework-pr.yml`);
  a comment-only edit reads as tampering and pressures a reseal.
- **PD-13** — the upstream factory template puts improvements in `openspec/changes/`,
  which breaks `openspec validate --all --strict`. Worked around: improvements
  live in `retro/improvements/`.

## Stopped at

S4b `export-share` preview archived (`2026-07-10-add-export-share-preview`).
Manual QA passed: HTML download, browser print/PDF, live preview.

**Next:** choose S5 `invoice-registry` (persist invoices) or S6 `export-share` pdf
(server PDF — wayfinder 05 for Type 3 glyphs).

## Blockers & open decisions

| Ticket | Topic | Blocks capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 05 | PDF fidelity — Chromium embeds glyphs as `Type 3` | export-share pdf |
| 16 | Edit after send (immutability) | invoice-edit |
| 11 | Design system reconciliation | form-input polish |
| PD-1 | `check-traceability.mjs` has no concept of `dropped` status: it counts `FR-NACE-06` + `FR-INPUT-03` among the 34 MVP FRs and demands tests/recordings for two deliberately dropped **negative** requirements | 69 of the 69 warnings; arming the git hooks |
| PD-2 | 10 archived slices carry no review evidence. **Documented, not resolved** — `.project-factory/retrofit.json` declares them RETROFITTED; retrofit records an absence, it does not supply the missing review | `check-trajectory --release` renders `NOT-EARNED` until a slice is earned red-first |
| PD-3 | `check-trajectory` was blind to retrofit and read 10 back-stamped `clean:true` files as real review evidence | **Fixed** — `improve-PD-3`, forged stamps deleted |
| PD-4 | the `add-form-input` stamp claimed `confirmed:0/clean:true` while its real review (`docs/qa/loop-add-form-input.md:39`) recorded PASS WITH NOTES + C1–C7 | **Fixed** — stamp deleted with `improve-PD-3` |
| PD-5 | retrofit doctrine sanctions `retrofit.json` only; the 10 `review-findings.json` were beyond mandate | **Fixed** — deleted with `improve-PD-3` |
| PD-7 | `gate-status.mjs` — the only aggregator carrying the RETROFIT banner and NOT-EARNED semantics — is absent from CI | CI can render green while `gate-status` is red |
| PD-8 | `check-trajectory` accepts any `{clean:true}` as review proof; ignores `confirmed`, `baseRef`, `dimensions` | future slices can be stamped, not reviewed |
| PD-9 | `check-traceability.mjs:148` parses `@trace` with `[A-Z]+-\d+`, which can never match categorized ids like `FR-CALC-01` that line 158 demands | 34 unclearable warnings; `--strict-tests` unsatisfiable |
| PD-10 | one docs commit (`5bcbfe9`) carries 10 `Slice:` trailers; `check-trajectory` greps the whole message and never checks the commit touched the slice's files | trailer evidence forgeable |

## Next up (priority order)

1. **Choose next slice:** S5 `invoice-registry` **or** S6 `export-share` pdf (`/opsx:propose add-invoice-registry` / `add-export-share-pdf`)
2. Wayfinder 05: `Type 3` glyph embedding (blocks pdf fidelity)
3. **Adversarial review** — form-input (separate checker chat; `docs/qa/loop-add-form-input.md`)
4. Land `improve-PD-9` (`@trace` regex) and `improve-PD-7` (`gate-status` in CI) — approved, same red→green + `Refs: PD-x` protocol as `improve-PD-3`
5. Tag MVP requirements with acceptance-method verification tags — `check-acceptance-methods --mode=existence` is red at `Scope: 0`, which gates G3
6. Arm hooks when ready: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
7. Triage PD-8 and PD-10 (forgeable review/trailer predicates) before the first *earned* slice archives, or S5 inherits the same weak evidence contract
